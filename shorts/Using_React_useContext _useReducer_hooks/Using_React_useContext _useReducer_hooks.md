# Using React - useContext + useReducer hooks

##### Date : December 26, 2024 | [#tech, #frontend]()

I recently created a basic todoapp which in modern react using useContext + useReducer context hooks.
Its pretty easy to create a small global state maangement using useReducer and useContext hooks.

useReducer + useContext hooks are a combination for developing small react applications with robust state management. useContext is been used to pass those dispatch actions and state to every component use can use useContext hook, which prevents you from doing prop drilling causing difficulties in managing state.
